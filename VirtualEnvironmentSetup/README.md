# ✨ Virtual Environment Setup
**Virtual Environment Setup will allow you to manage your functions on a per-porject basis. Each virtual environment gets its own copy/link to your functions that are isolated from other projects and system Python**


#### Advantages
✅ **Isolation:** No conflicts between different projects

✅ **Clean environments:** Each project has exactly what it needs

✅ **Version control:** Requirements.txt tracks dependencies

✅ **Professional workflow:** Industry standard practice

#### Disadvantages
❌ **Not universal:** Must install in each environment separately

❌ **Extra steps:** Requires activation and installation per project

❌ **Duplication:** Multiple copies of the same functions
